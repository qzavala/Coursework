                                                 // WORKSHOP 1

    // Unit Tests:

        // 1. A function called "multiplication" that returns the product of the two input numbers.

//  Expect multiply (3, 2) to be a number
//  Expect multiply (3, 2) to be equal to 6
//  Expect multiply ("3", 2) to be an error


        //  2. A function called "concatOdds" takes two arrays of integers as arguments. It should return a single array that only contains the odd numbers, in ascending order, from both of the arrays.

// Expect non integers in array to display error
// Expect same integers in array to not repeat
// Expect odd number to only show
// Expect odd numbers to show in ascending order
// Expect function to return a single array


    // Functional Tests:

        // 1. A shopping cart checkout feature that allows a user to check out as a guest (without an account), or as a logged-in user. They should be allowed to do either, but should be asked if they want to create an account or log in if they check out as a guest.

// When a user clicks "checkout" it redirects user to sign in page or continue as guest option
// When a user is in the "sign in" page theres a create account button option
// When a user creates account with invalid email address or password they should be shown an error
// When a user signs in but has filled an incorrect login/password they are shown an error
// When a user succesfully signs into account they are taken to checkout page
// When a user checkouts as guest they are taken to checkout page
// When user is at checkout page user sees items in cart and total price
// When user is at checkout page but cart is empty they are shown "cart is empty" message
// When user clicks pay on checkout page they are given multiple ways to pay: cash, card, ebt, google pay, etc
// When user succesully pays cart they are given a change if applicable and reciept
